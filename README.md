# Automatic Fetal Brain Localization and Segmentation 
This repository provides source code and pre-trained models for fetal brain localization and segmentation from fetal MRI. The method is detailed in [1]. If you use any resources in this repository, please cite the following papers:

# Requirements
* A CUDA compatable GPU with memory not less than 6GB is recommended for training. For testing only, a CUDA compatable GPU may not be required.

* Tensorflow 1.12.0. Install it by typing `pip install tensorflow-gpu=1.12` or following instructions from https://www.tensorflow.org/install. 

* NiftyNet 0.2.0. Install it by typing `pip install niftynet=0.2` or downloading the source files from https://github.com/NifTK/NiftyNet/releases/tag/v0.2.0.

* Demic (a tool to use NiftyNet) v0.1. Download the source files from https://github.com/taigw/Demic/releases/tag/v0.1 and add the path of Demic to `PYTHONPATH environment variable.

# How to use
* To get fetal brain detection and segmentation results, run `bash/inference.sh`. You need to edit the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable in that file so that it includes the path of NiftyNet and Demic.

* You can edit `cfg_data.txt` to customize the input and output image names.

* Alternatively, you can run the following command after setting `PYTHONPATH` environment variable correctly.

```bash
python fetal_brain_seg.py --input_names demo_data/image1.nii.gz demo_data/image2.nii.gz --segment_output_names demo_data/image1_segment.nii.gz demo_data/image2_segment.nii.gz 
```

Or the following command that will save detection results.

```bash
python fetal_brain_seg.py --input_names demo_data/image1.nii.gz demo_data/image2.nii.gz --segment_output_names demo_data/image1_segment.nii.gz demo_data/image2_segment.nii.gz --detect_output_names demo_data/image1_detect.nii.gz demo_data/image2_detect.nii.gz
```
